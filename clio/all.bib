% Students are free to edit this to add new entries, but please 
% do it in the RIGHT WAY.
%
% What is the right way?
%
% Well, instead of typing in all the conference info, etc., in the
% InProceedings{}, you should use cross references. The cross references
% below refer to conferences in all-confs.bib. If the conference you
% wish to refer to is not in there, add it! But check first.
%
% A good InProceedings{} will thus have the following entries:
%   author
%   title
%   crossref
%   pages 
%
% There are some examples right below, added by some mysterious do-gooder.
% Thanks!
%
% The page numbers are particularly nice to track down if you can manage it.
%
% Questions? Ask Andrea or Remzi.
