\section{Conclusion}

%\vspace{-0.05in}

We presented \sys, a new hardware-based disaggregated memory system.
Our FPGA prototype demonstrates that \sys\ achieves great performance, scalability, and cost saving.
This work not only guides the future development of \md\ solutions
but also demonstrates how to implement a core OS subsystem in hardware and co-design it with the network.
%and \sys, a real system built with this model.
%\sys\ outperforms passive disaggregated memory system and 
%achieves comparable performance as CPU-based active disaggregated memory,
%while significantly reducing the monetary cost of server-based disaggregated memory systems.
