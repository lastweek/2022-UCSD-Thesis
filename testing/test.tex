% Include all packages you need here.  
% Some standard options are suggested below.
%
% See the project wiki for information on how to use 
% these packages. Other useful packages are also listed there.
%
%   http://code.google.com/p/ucsd-thesis/wiki/GettingStarted



%% AMS PACKAGES - Chances are you will want some or all 
%    of these if writing a dissertation that includes equations.
%  \usepackage{amsmath, amscd, amssymb, amsthm}

%% GRAPHICX - This is the standard package for 
%    including graphics for latex/pdflatex.
\usepackage{graphicx}

%% SUBFIGURE - Use this to place multiple images in a
%    single figure.  Subfigure will handle placement and
%    proper captioning (e.g. Figure 1.2(a))
% \usepackage{subfigure}

%% LATIN MODERN FONTS (replacements for Computer Modern)
% \usepackage{lmodern}
% \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

%% INDEX
%   Uncomment the following two lines to create an index: 
\usepackage{makeidx}
\makeindex
%   You will need to uncomment the \printindex line near the
%   bibliography to display the index.  Use the command
% \index{keyword} 
%   within the text to create an entry in the index for keyword.

%% HYPERLINKS
%   To create a PDF with hyperlinks, you need to include the hyperref package.
%   THIS HAS TO BE THE LAST PACKAGE INCLUDED!
%   Note that the options plainpages=false and pdfpagelabels exist
%   to fix indexing associated with having both (ii) and (2) as pages.
%   Also, all links must be black according to OGS.
%   See: http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=hyperdupdest
%   Note: This may not work correctly with all DVI viewers (i.e. Yap breaks).
%   NOTE: hyperref will NOT work in draft mode, as noted above.
% \usepackage[colorlinks=true, pdfstartview=FitV, 
%             linkcolor=black, citecolor=black, 
%             urlcolor=black, plainpages=false,
%             pdfpagelabels]{hyperref}
% \hypersetup{ pdfauthor = {Your Name Here}, 
%              pdftitle = {The Title of The Dissertation}, 
%              pdfkeywords = {Keywords for Searching}, 
%              pdfcreator = {pdfLaTeX with hyperref package}, 
%              pdfproducer = {pdfLaTeX} }


\usepackage{verbatim}

\begin{document}



%% FRONT MATTER
%
%  All of the front matter.
%  This includes the title, degree, dedication, vita, abstract, etc..
%  Modify the file template_frontmatter.tex to change these pages.
\include{test_frontmatter}





%% DISSERTATION

% A common strategy here is to include files for each of the chapters. I.e.,
% Place the chapters is separate files: 
%   chapter1.tex, chapter2.tex
% Then use the commands:
%   \include{chapter1}
%   \include{chapter2}
%
% Of course, if you prefer, you can just start with
%   \chapter{My First Chapter Name}
% and start typing away.

The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across his eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or two sobs choked his voice. `Same as if he had a bone in his throat,' said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in the back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears running down his cheeks, he went on again:


\begin{verbatim}
``There's a porpoise close behind us, and he's treading on my tail.
See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!
They are waiting on the shingle--will you come and join the dance?

Will you, won't you, 
                will you, won't you, 
                                will you join the dance?
Will you, won't you, 
                will you, won't you, 
                                won't you join the dance?''
\end{verbatim}



So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first, the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened their eyes and mouths so very wide, but she gained courage as she went on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about her repeating `You are Old, Father William,' to the Caterpillar\footnote{Which we introduced in a different thesis}, and the words all coming different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath, and said `That's very curious'.
