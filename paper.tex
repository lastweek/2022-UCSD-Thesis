% UCSD Doctoral Dissertation Template
% -----------------------------------
% https://github.com/ucsd-thesis/ucsd-thesis
%

% Setup the documentclass 
% default options: 12pt, oneside, final
%
% fonts: 10pt, 11pt, 12pt -- are valid for UCSD dissertations.
% sides: oneside, twoside -- note that two-sided theses are not accepted 
%                            by OGS.
% mode: draft, final      -- draft mode switches to single spacing, 
%                            removes hyperlinks, and places a black box
%                            at every overfull hbox (check these before
%                            submission).
% chapterheads            -- Include this if you want your chapters to read:
%                              Chapter 1
%                              Title of Chapter
%
%                            instead of
%                              1 Title of Chapter
\documentclass[12pt,chapterheads]{ucsd}



% Include all packages you need here.  
% Some standard options are suggested below.
%
% See the project wiki for information on how to use 
% these packages. Other useful packages are also listed there.
%
%   http://code.google.com/p/ucsd-thesis/wiki/GettingStarted



%% AMS PACKAGES - Chances are you will want some or all 
%    of these if writing a dissertation that includes equations.
%  \usepackage{amsmath, amscd, amssymb, amsthm}

%% BONUS MATH
%  \usepackage{mathtools} 

%% MARGIN REQUIREMENTS IN TITLES - Hyphenation in a Section Title does not always respect margin settings in Latex.  To force no hyphentation, uncomment the package below.
%  \usepackage[raggedright]{titlesec} 

%% GRAPHICX - This is the standard package for 
%    including graphics for latex/pdflatex.
\usepackage{scrextend}
\usepackage{pslatex}
\usepackage{graphicx}

%% CAPTION
% This overrides some of the ugliness in ucsd.cls and
% allows the text to be double-spaced while letting figures,
% tables, and footnotes to be single-spaced--all OGS requirements.
% NOTE: Must appear after graphics and ams math
\makeatletter
\gdef\@ptsize{2}% 12pt documents
\let\@currsize\normalsize
\makeatother
\usepackage{setspace}
\doublespace
\usepackage[font=small, width=0.9\textwidth]{caption}
\usepackage{subcaption}
\usepackage[capposition=bottom]{floatrow} %force captions below figure per OGS requirement

\usepackage{soul}
\usepackage{ulem}

%% SUBFIG - Use this to place multiple images in a
%    single figure.  Subfig will handle placement and
%    proper captioning (e.g. Figure 1.2(a))
% \usepackage{subfig}

%% TIMES FONT - replacements for Computer Modern
%%   This package will replace the default font with a
%%   Times-Roman font with math support.
% \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
% \usepackage{mathptmx}

%% INDEX
%   Uncomment the following two lines to create an index: 
% \usepackage{makeidx}
% \makeindex
%   You will need to uncomment the \printindex line near the
%   bibliography to display the index.  Use the command
% \index{keyword} 
%   within the text to create an entry in the index for keyword.
%   To compile a LaTeX document with an index the 'makeindex'
%   command will need to be run.  See the wiki for more details.

%% HYPERLINKS
%   To create a PDF with hyperlinks, you need to include the hyperref package.
%   THIS HAS TO BE THE LAST PACKAGE INCLUDED!
%   Note that the options plainpages=false and pdfpagelabels exist
%   to fix indexing associated with having both (ii) and (2) as pages.
%   Also, all links must be black according to OGS.
%   See: http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=hyperdupdest
%   Note: This may not work correctly with all DVI viewers (i.e. Yap breaks).
%   NOTE: hyperref will NOT work in draft mode, as noted above.
\usepackage[colorlinks=true, pdfstartview=FitV,
            linkcolor=black, citecolor=black,
            urlcolor=black, plainpages=false,
            pdfpagelabels]{hyperref}
% \hypersetup{ pdfauthor = {Your Name Here}, 
%              pdftitle = {The Title of The Dissertation}, 
%              pdfkeywords = {Keywords for Searching}, 
%              pdfcreator = {pdfLaTeX with hyperref package}, 
%              pdfproducer = {pdfLaTeX} }
% \urlstyle{same}
% \usepackage{bookmark}


%% CITATIONS
% Sets citation format
% and fixes up citations madness
\usepackage{microtype}  % avoids citations that hang into the margin


%% FOOTNOTE-MAGIC
% Enables footnotes in tables, re-referencing the same footnote multiple times.
\usepackage{footnote}
\makesavenoteenv{tabular}
\makesavenoteenv{table}


%% TABLE FORMATTING MADNESS
% Enable all sorts of fun table tricks
\usepackage{rotating}  % Enables the sideways environment (NCPW)
\usepackage{array}  % Enables "m" tabular environment http://ctan.org/pkg/array
\usepackage{booktabs}  % Enables \toprule  http://ctan.org/pkg/array

\input{macros}

\begin{document}

%% FRONT MATTER
%
%  All of the front matter.
%  This includes the title, degree, dedication, vita, abstract, etc..
%  Modify the file template_frontmatter.tex to change these pages.
\include{paper_frontmatter}





%% DISSERTATION

% A common strategy here is to include files for each of the chapters. I.e.,
% Place the chapters is separate files: 
%   chapter1.tex, chapter2.tex
% Then use the commands:
%   \include{chapter1}
%   \include{chapter2}
%
% Of course, if you prefer, you can just start with
%   \chapter{My First Chapter Name}
% and start typing away.  
\chapter{Introduction}
This is only a test.
\section{A section}
Test.

\subsection{A Figure Example}
\label{ssec:figure_example}

This subsection shows a sample figure.

\begin{figure}[h] 
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{sandiego}
  \caption[A picture of San Diego. Short figure caption must be \protect{$< 4$} lines in the list of figures]
{A picture of San Diego.  Short figure caption must be \protect{$< 4$} lines in the list of figures and match the start of the main figure caption verbatim. Note that figures must be on their own line (no neighboring text) and captions must be single-spaced and appear \protect\textit{below} the figure.  Captions can be as long as you want, but if they are longer than 4 lines in the list of figures, you must provide a short figure caption.\index{SanDiego}}
  \label{fig:sandiego}
\end{figure}

\subsection{A Table Example}

While in Section \ref{ssec:figure_example} Figure \ref{fig:sandiego} we had a majestic figure, here we provide a crazy table example.

\begin{table}[!ht]
\caption[A table of when I get hungry.  Short table caption must be \protect{$< 4$} lines in the list of tables]{A table of when I get hungry. Short table caption must be \protect{$< 4$} lines in the list of tables and match the start of the main table caption verbatim.  Note that tables must be on their own line (no neighboring text) and captions must be single-spaced and appear \protect\textit{above} the table.  Captions can be as long as you want, but if they are longer than 4 lines in the list of figures, you must provide a short figure caption.}
