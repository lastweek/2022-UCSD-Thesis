\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:hotpot:conclude}

We presented \hotpot, a kernel-level DSPM system that provides applications
with a shared persistent memory abstraction. Our evaluation results show that
it is easy to port existing applications to Hotpot and the resulting systems
significantly outperform existing solutions.
