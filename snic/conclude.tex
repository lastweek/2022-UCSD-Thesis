\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:snic:conclude}

We propose network disaggregation and consolidation by building SuperNIC, a new networking device specifically for a disaggregated datacenter.
Our FPGA prototype demonstrates the performance and cost benefits of \snic.
Our experience also reveals many new challenges in a new networking design space that could guide future researchers.
